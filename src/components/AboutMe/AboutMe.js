            Hi! My friends call me Ema. My professional career start in 2015
            when i join at the college "UNAM" (National University of Misiones)
            learning computer science. Since then i start doing my own research
            about software development and discovered my true profession. I am a
            very curious person, love to learn how and why the things work, so i
            think web development exactly fit in what i was searching for. My
            true contact with Web development start in 2019, when i meet React.
            I started learning JavaScript and quickly jump to this beautifull
            library. Keep scrolling down for more information about me. Thank
            for joining me here. Letâ€™s keep in touch!
          </p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
